To estimate the effect of allocation on the expected severe-case incidence, we employ a simulation-assisted causal modeling approach that combines a compartmental infection-dynamics simulation, a coarse-grained causal model, and literature estimates for immunity waning. We compare Israel’s strategy, implemented in 2021, with counterfactual strategies such as no prioritization, prioritization of younger age groups, or a strict risk-ranked approach; we find that Israel’s implemented strategy was indeed highly effective. We also study the impact of increasing vaccine uptake for given age groups. Because of its modular structure, our model can easily be adapted to study future pandemics. We demonstrate this by simulating a pandemic with characteristics of the Spanish flu. Our approach helps evaluate vaccination strategies under the complex interplay of core epidemic factors, including age-dependent risk profiles, immunity waning, vaccine availability, and spreading rates.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating vaccine allocation strategies using simulation-assisted causal modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Kunz","Stefan Birr","Mones Raslan","Lei Ma","Zhen Li","Adele Gouttes","Mateusz Koren","Tofigh Naghibi","Johannes Stephan","Mariia Bulycheva","Matthias Grzeschik","Armin Kekić","Michael Narodovitch","Kashif Rasul","Julian Sieber","Tim Januschowski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1684839600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684839600,"objectID":"d56bad6fb185af38730e4092cd1f46bb","permalink":"https://akekic.github.io/publication/deep-learning-based/","publishdate":"2023-05-25T12:01:22+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/deep-learning-based/","section":"publication","summary":"Demand forecasting in the online fashion industry is particularly amendable to global, data-driven forecasting models because of the industry's set of particular challenges. These include the volume of data, the irregularity, the high amount of turn-over in the catalog and the fixed inventory assumption.

Eastwood \u0026 Williams (2018) proposed three metrics for quantifying the quality of such disentangled representations: disentanglement (D), completeness (C) and informativeness (I). In this work, we first connect this DCI framework to two common notions of linear and nonlinear identifiability, thereby establishing a formal link between disentanglement and the closely-related field of independent component analysis. We then propose an extended DCI-ES framework with two new measures of representation quality - explicitness (E) and size (S) - and point out how D and C can be computed for black-box predictors. Our main idea is that the functional capacity required to use a representation is an important but thus-far neglected aspect of representation quality, which we quantify using explicitness or ease-of-use (E). We illustrate the relevance of our extensions on the MPI3D and Cars3D datasets.","tags":[],"title":"On the DCI Framework for Evaluating Disentangled Representations: Extensions and Connections to Identifiability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Wellnitz","Armin Kekić","Julian Heiss","Michael Gertz","Matthias Weidemüller","Andreas Spitz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1644490800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644490800,"objectID":"f59cf5983d77309c94978397ddaba08f","permalink":"https://akekic.github.io/publication/a-network-approach/","publishdate":"2022-08-20T12:01:22+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/a-network-approach/","section":"publication","summary":"Network science provides a universal framework for modeling complex systems, contrasting the reductionist approach generally adopted in physics. In a prototypical study, we utilize network models created from spectroscopic data of atoms to predict microscopic properties of the underlying physical system. For simple atoms such as helium, an a posteriori inspection of spectroscopic network communities reveals the emergence of quantum numbers and symmetries. For more complex atoms such as thorium, finer network hierarchies suggest additional microscopic symmetries or configurations. Link prediction yields a quantitative ranking of yet unknown atomic transitions, offering opportunities to discover new spectral lines in a well-controlled manner. Our work promotes a genuine bi-directional exchange of methodology between network science and physics, and presents new perspectives for the study of atomic spectra.","tags":[],"title":"A Network Approach to Atomic Spectra","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne **Two** Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

We consider interfaces between media with different exponents in the interaction potential. For an interface with increasing interaction potential exponent along the propagation direction we obtain mainly transmission with delayed secondary transmitted and reflected pulses. For interfaces with decreasing interaction potential exponent we observe both significant reflection and transmission of the solitary wave, where the transmitted part of the wave forms a multipulse structure. We also investigate impurities consisting of beads with different interaction exponents compared to the media they are embedded in, and we find that the impurities cause both reflection and transmission, including the formation of multipulse structures, independent of whether the exponent in the impurities is smaller than in the surrounding media. We explain wave propagation effects at interfaces and impurities in terms of quasi-particle collisions. Next we consider wave propagation along Hertz-like granular chains of beads in the presence of disorder and periodicity in the interaction exponents present in the Hertz-like potential, modelling, for instance, inhomogeneity in the contact geometry between beads in the granular chain. We find that solitary waves in media with randomised interaction exponents (which models disorder in the contact geometry) experience exponential decay, where the dependence of the decay rate is similar to the case of randomised bead masses. In the periodic case of chains with interaction exponents alternating between two fixed values, we find qualitatively different propagation properties depending on the choice of the two exponents. In particular, we find regimes with either exponential decay or stable solitary wave propagation with pairwise collective behaviour. For some specific interaction exponent values, we observe a new type of stable confined wave which exhibits a periodically changing wave form. These results cast light on how inhomogeneity in the contact geometry will influence solitary wave propagation along Hertz-like granular chains.","tags":[],"title":"Wave propagation across interfaces induced by different interaction exponents in ordered and disordered Hertz-like granular chains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Armin Kekić"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1472727600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472727600,"objectID":"b01146d81e3156758501b9aa2639e71e","permalink":"https://akekic.github.io/publication/masters-thesis/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T11:00:32+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/masters-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"In this dissertation we present a numerical study of solitary wave propagation in 1D granular crystals with Hertz-like interaction potentials.

Here we present a detailed study of this technique, applied to detect Rydberg P states. We experimentally realize fast and efficient three-photon excitation of P states, optimized according to the results of a theoretical effective two-level model. Few Rydberg P-state atoms, prepared in a small cloud with dimensions comparable to the blockade radius, are detected with a good sensitivity by averaging over 50 shots. The main aspects of the technique are described with a hard-sphere model, finding good agreement with experimental data. This work paves the way to a non-destructive optical detection of single Rydberg atoms with high spatial and temporal resolution.","tags":[],"title":"Interaction Enhanced Imaging of Rydberg P states - Preparation and detection of Rydberg atoms for engineering long-range interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Armin Kekić"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1440759600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1440759600,"objectID":"39991e13feb6a917e0b638d49d5498db","permalink":"https://akekic.github.io/publication/bachelors-thesis/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T11:42:03+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bachelors-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"The effective excitation of atomic states is a key ingredient in quantum-dynamics experiments using ultracold gases. The excitation of Rydberg-P-states using a three-photon scheme allows for implementing an experimental excitation set-up capable of addressing both S- and P-states. The theoretical description of such an excitation process involves many independent parameters, making it difficult to choose them such that the population transfer into the desired state is optimised. In this thesis the three- photon excitation is investigated theoretically by means of analytical descriptions and numerical simulations. An effective analytical description is presented for the case of three-photon resonance and large detunings on the intermediate states. It is shown that, to a good approximation, the excitation can be described using only two effective parameters, allowing for an intuitive understanding and a simplified experimental optimisation. The numerical simulations of the full system are compared to the analytical models and show good agreement in the parameter regime relevant to the experiment.","tags":[],"title":"Three-photon excitation of Rydberg-P-states","type":"publication"}]
